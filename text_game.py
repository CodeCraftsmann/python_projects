 Introduction: The Awakening
You wake up in complete darkness, lying on a cold, damp surface. A faint, musty smell fills your nostrils, 
and the distant sound of dripping water echoes through what seems to be a vast, underground cavern. 
Your head throbs, and your memory is foggyâ€”you have no recollection of how you got here.

As you sit up and rub your temples, your eyes adjust to the dim light filtering through cracks in the 
cave walls. The rocky floor beneath you is uneven, scattered with loose stones and what feels like... bones?


Panic creeps in. You need to get out.

In front of you, two paths lead deeper into the unknown. One veers left, where the air feels slightly 
warmer, and you hear faint rustling sounds. The other leads right, where the path is cold and eerily silent.
